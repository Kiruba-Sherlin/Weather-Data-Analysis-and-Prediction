Domain: Artificial Intelligence

Duration: One Month

Description about the task: Weather Data Analysis and Prediction

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language for data processing and modeling
Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and time handling
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling
Matplotlib: For plotting historical and predicted temperature trends
Scikit-learn: For building and training the Linear Regression model

This project focuses on predicting the maximum daily temperature for the next 30 days in Seattle using Linear Regression. It begins by loading and cleaning historical weather data, specifically focusing on the daily maximum temperature (temp_max). The dates are converted into numerical values representing the number of days since the start of the dataset, allowing the regression model to learn the relationship between time and temperature. After training the model with scikit-learn's LinearRegression, it generates temperature predictions for the next 30 days. Both historical and predicted temperatures are visualized using matplotlib, providing an intuitive look at the temperature trend and forecast. This project demonstrates a simple and effective approach to time-based temperature prediction using machine learning.
